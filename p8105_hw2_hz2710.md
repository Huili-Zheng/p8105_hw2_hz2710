## Problem 1

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

``` r
wheel_df = 
  read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",range = "A2:N406" ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na("dumpster") %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls)
  ) 
```

Read and clean precipitation data for 2018 and 2019.

``` r
pre2018_df = 
  read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
             range = "A2:B14") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na("total") %>%
  mutate(
    year = 2018
  )
pre2019_df = 
  read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             sheet = "2019 Precipitation",
             range = "A2:B14") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na("total") %>%
  mutate(
    year = 2019
  )

pre_df = 
  left_join(pre2018_df, pre2019_df, by = "month") %>%
  mutate(
    mouth = month.name[month]
  )
```

The number of observations in Mr.Trash Wheel dataset is 344 and the
number of observations in precipitation data is 12. The key variables of
Mr.Trash Wheel dataset include “weight\_tons” and
“volume\_cubic\_yards”. The key variables of precipitation data are
“month” and “total”. The total precipitation in 2018 is 70.33. The
median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2019 is 8.5.
